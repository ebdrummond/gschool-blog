<h5>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 heaping tsp coconut oil*</li>
  <li>1 1/2 tsp protein powder**</li>
  <li>1 1/2 heaping cups frozen fruit</li>
  <li>Rice milk</li>
</ul>

<p>Go nuts with what kinds of fruit you want and try different pairings.  Peaches, mangoes, berries, cherries... it's all good.</p>
<br>

<h5>Instructions</h5>
<p>Put coconut oil, protein powder, and fruit in a blender (I prefer to use an immersion blender in a sturdy mixing beaker).  Pour in rice milk until it fills in the cracks between pieces of fruit.  Blend.  Enjoy.</p>

<br>
<p>* Just in case I am not the only one who didn't realize what coconut oil was - it's not a liquid, it's a solid.</p>
<p>** I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omega-Nutrition-Pumpkin-Protein-21-Ounce/dp/B004L3VLFK/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1393604845&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=pumpkin+protein+powder">this one</a>.</p>
